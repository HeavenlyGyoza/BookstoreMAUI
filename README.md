> ⚠️ **Project Status**: _Inactive_  
> This project was created as a learning exercise to explore cross-platform development using .NET MAUI.  
> While it served its purpose, I found MAUI to have too many rough edges, bugs, and missing capabilities for production use.  
> Maintaining and building on this stack proved inefficient, so I’ve decided to pause further development.  
> I may revisit this concept in the future using a different, more robust technology stack.
